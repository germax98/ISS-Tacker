## Description DataFetching

The  code is a React component that fetches the current position of the International Space Station (ISS) from the API provided by "Where the ISS at?" (https://wheretheiss.at/) and displays the latitude and longitude of the ISS position on the screen. The position data is updated every 30 seconds.

The component uses the useState and useEffect hooks from the React library. The useState hook is used to define a state variable issPosition which will hold the current ISS position data. The useEffect hook is used to fetch the position data from the API and update the issPosition state variable. The useEffect hook also schedules a recurring fetch of the data every 30 seconds using the setInterval function.

The Map component is defined as a function that returns JSX code. Inside the component, the issPosition state variable is checked to see if it is not null before rendering the latitude and longitude data on the screen. If the issPosition state is null, nothing will be displayed.

Finally, the component is exported as the default export of the module, which allows it to be used in other parts of the application.
